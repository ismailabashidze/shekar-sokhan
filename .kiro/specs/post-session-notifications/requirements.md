# Comprehensive Push Notification System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive push notification system for Zehna that supports multiple notification types including post-session engagement notifications, admin-initiated messages to user groups, system alerts, and general-purpose messaging. The system must work reliably when the app is closed or in the background, utilizing Firebase Cloud Messaging and PocketBase for data management.

5. THE Message_Generator SHALL avoid repetitive or generic messaging patterns

### Requirement 5: User Engagement Tracking

**User Story:** As a therapy app user, I want the system to learn from my notification interactions, so that future notifications are optimized for my engagement patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Engagement_Monitor SHALL track notification delivery, open rates, and click-through rates
2. WHEN a notification is clicked, THE System SHALL record the interaction timestamp and target action
3. THE User_Engagement_Monitor SHALL identify optimal notification timing based on user response patterns
4. THE System SHALL adjust notification frequency based on user engagement levels
5. WHEN a user consistently ignores notifications, THE System SHALL reduce notification frequency automatically

### Requirement 6: Notification Management and Controls

**User Story:** As a therapy app user, I want to control my notification preferences and manage received notifications, so that I have full control over my notification experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Zehna_App SHALL provide notification preference settings including frequency, timing, and types
2. WHEN a user disables notifications, THE System SHALL respect the preference and stop sending notifications
3. THE System SHALL provide a notification history view showing past notifications and their status
4. THE Zehna_App SHALL allow users to mark notifications as read or dismiss them
5. THE System SHALL support notification snoozing with customizable snooze durations

### Requirement 7: System Reliability and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a therapy app user, I want the notification system to work reliably without failures, so that I can depend on receiving important therapy reminders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL handle FCM token expiration and refresh tokens automatically
2. WHEN notification delivery fails, THE System SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. THE System SHALL log all notification events for debugging and monitoring purposes
4. WHEN PocketBase_DB is unavailable, THE System SHALL queue notifications for later delivery
5. THE System SHALL validate notification payload before sending to prevent delivery failures

### Requirement 8: Admin-Initiated Group Notifications
